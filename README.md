# OnlyNotes App

### A React.js , MongoDB , Express , Node.js project - {MERN Project}

#### OnlyNotes is an online application for creating notes where you may store your notes in a database and edit, read, and remove them as needed. It is a full-stack application with a database connection created in MERN (Mongo, Express, React.js and Node.js), where I had completed all CRUD operations.
